# Open Skynet

AI bots for Discord (other platforms will be added if there's a demand)

## Supported Bots:
- ChatGPT (chats with you)
- Stable Diffusion (generates images)

## Usage

For $5 / month or $30 / year you get access to all supported bots. Cost is calculated per discord serer.

Pay & Install bots here.

Try before you buy: you can demo the bots in the open skynet discord. 

## Limits

Currently we have the following soft limits for bot usage:

- ChatGPT: 1500 prompt responses per month per discord server
- Stable Diffusion: 500 prompt responses per month per discord sever

We will increase these limits in the future as usage & backend scales. These are considered soft limits as we might allow some high demand discord servers to breach these limits if overall usage between all servers is low.

## Contributions

Use github issues to request improvements / fixes for the service.
Issues will be assigned a score for value add to each bot. Revenue share will be given to contributors based on their bot contribution score * % customer usage of bot * total revenue.
